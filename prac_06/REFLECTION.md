# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?
I’ve started breaking down each practical into smaller tasks and tackling them incrementally. This approach has helped me manage complex problems more effectively and reduced last-minute stress.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?
I need to be more consistent with practicing coding outside of assigned tasks. Regular practice on platforms like LeetCode or HackerRank would strengthen my problem-solving skills.


## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?
I’ve been diligent about testing my code thoroughly, using both manual and automated tests. This ensures my programs are robust, and I’ll continue this habit to maintain high-quality work.


## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?
I should stop underestimating the time required for debugging and refactoring. Allocating more time for these steps would improve my efficiency and code quality.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?
I suggest incorporating more real-world case studies into the lectures, showing how concepts like classes are used in industry projects. This would make the material more relatable and practical.
