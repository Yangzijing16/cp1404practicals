# Practicals Repository

## Overview
This repository contains my practical assignments for the CP1404 Programming subject. It includes exercises on Python programming, focusing on object-oriented programming, clean code principles, and version control with Git.

## About Me
I am Zijing Yang, a student learning Python and software development. This repository showcases my progress in applying programming patterns and writing clean, maintainable code.

## Key Lessons on Clean Code
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Each function and class should have one clear purpose, making code easier to understand and maintain.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Avoid duplicating code by using functions and classes to reuse logic, improving efficiency and reducing errors.
- **Meaningful Naming:** Use descriptive variable and function names to make code self-documenting and reduce the need for excessive comments.
